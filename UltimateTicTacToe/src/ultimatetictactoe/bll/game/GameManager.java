 * through the constructors means that you have to create a new instance of the
 * game manager for every new game of a different type (e.g. Human vs Human,
 * Human vs Bot or Bot vs Bot), which may not be ideal for your solution, so you
 * could consider refactoring that into an (re-)initialize method instead.
